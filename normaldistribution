CLT:

If we take infinite samples from normal dist, then distribution of the sample means is bell shaped with a mean equal to the population mean. 
Sampling distribution of sample mean is always normal.

Stats Pioneers

Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis was an Indian scientist and an applied statistician. He is remembered for the distance of Mahalanobis, a statistical measure, 
and for being one of the members of the first Planning Commission of Free India. He made pioneering studies in anthropometry in India. 
Google Doodle is celebrating his 125th birth anniversary.


Father of Statistics :
Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher
Biologist and studied genetics
Fisher was a genius who almost single-handedly created the foundations for modern statistical science. His contributions to experimental design, analysis of variance, and likelihood based methods

Pearson: 
Karl Pearson (1857 - 1936) was a major contributor to the early development of statistics, and founder of the world's first university statistics department at University College London in 1911. He was also an ardent and controversial proponent of eugenics. His most famous contribution is the Pearson's chi-square test and correlation.

Student (William Sealy Gosset)
A chemist and statistician, better known by his pen name Student. 
Q: He worked in a beer brewery and his testing of very small patches led him to discover certain small-sample distributions.
This led to the development of Student's t-Test. His communications with Fisher on the subject are legendary. 

Carl Friedrich Gauss
The normal distribution is a probability distribution. It is also called Gaussian distribution because it was discovered by Carl Friedrich Gauss.
